Step 1: Define the `Movie` class
```python
class Movie:
    def __init__(self, title, year, genres):
        self.title = title
        self.year = year
        self.genres = genres
```
Here, we define the `Movie` class with an `__init__` method that serves as the constructor. The `__init__` method initializes the `title`, `year`, and `genres` attributes of each `Movie` object.

Step 2: Define the `sort_by_most_recent_year` function
```python
def sort_by_most_recent_year(movies):
    return sorted(movies, key=lambda movie: movie.year, reverse=True)
```
This function takes a list of `Movie` objects as input and returns a new list of `Movie` objects sorted in descending order based on the `year` attribute. It uses the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key to specify the sorting criterion. The lambda function `lambda movie: movie.year` extracts the `year` attribute from each `Movie` object for sorting, and `reverse=True` ensures the sorting is done in descending order.

Step 3: Define the `sort_alphabetically_by_title` function
```python
def sort_alphabetically_by_title(movies):
    def custom_title_comparison(movie):
        ignore_words = ["A", "An", "The"]
        title = movie.title

        def remove_leading_words(title):
            words = title.split(" ")
            if words[0] in ignore_words:
                return " ".join(words[1:])
            return title

        modified_title = remove_leading_words(title)
        return modified_title

    return sorted(movies, key=custom_title_comparison)
```
This function takes a list of `Movie` objects as input and returns a new list of `Movie` objects sorted alphabetically by title while ignoring leading "A"s, "An"s, or "The"s. It defines a nested function `custom_title_comparison`, which serves as a custom comparison function for the `sorted` function.

Inside `custom_title_comparison`, we define a list called `ignore_words` containing the words "A", "An", and "The," which are to be ignored for sorting purposes. The function `remove_leading_words(title)` is defined to remove these leading words from the `title` of a movie, and it is used to generate a modified title that will be used for sorting.

The `sort_alphabetically_by_title` function then uses the `sorted` function with `custom_title_comparison` as the key to perform the sorting. The `custom_title_comparison` function is applied to each `Movie` object in the list to extract the modified title for sorting.

Step 4: Create a list of `Movie` objects
```python
movies = [
    Movie("The Avengers", 2012, ["Action", "Adventure", "Sci-Fi"]),
    Movie("Avatar", 2009, ["Action", "Adventure", "Fantasy"]),
    Movie("Anchorman", 2004, ["Comedy"]),
    Movie("A Quiet Place", 2018, ["Drama", "Horror", "Sci-Fi"]),
]
```
Here, we create a list named `movies` containing four `Movie` objects with their respective titles, years, and genres.

Step 5: Sort by most recent year and print the result
```python
sorted_by_year_list = sort_by_most_recent_year(movies)
clearly_list = []
for i in sorted_by_year_list:
    clearly_list.append([i.title, i.year])
print(clearly_list)
```
We use the `sort_by_most_recent_year` function to sort the `movies` list by the most recent year. The sorted result is stored in the `sorted_by_year_list`. We then iterate through this list and create a new list `clearly_list` containing only the titles and years of the movies. Finally, we print `clearly_list`.

Step 6: Sort alphabetically by title and print the result
```python
sorted_by_title = sort_alphabetically_by_title(movies)
clearly_list = []
for i in sorted_by_title:
    clearly_list.append(i.title)
print(clearly_list)
```
We use the `sort_alphabetically_by_title` function to sort the `movies` list alphabetically by title while ignoring leading "A"s, "An"s, or "The"s. The sorted result is stored in `sorted_by_title`. We then iterate through this list and create a new list `clearly_list` containing only the titles of the movies. Finally, we print `clearly_list`.

Step 7: Output
When you run the entire code, you will get the following output:

```
[['The Avengers', 2012], ['A Quiet Place', 2018], ['Avatar', 2009], ['Anchorman', 2004]]
['Anchorman', 'Avatar', 'A Quiet Place', 'The Avengers']
```

The first list contains the titles and years of the movies, sorted in descending order based on the year. The second list contains the titles of the movies, sorted alphabetically while ignoring leading "A"s, "An"s, or "The"s.
